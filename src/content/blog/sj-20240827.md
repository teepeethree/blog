# Where I'm at

- Currently working through my personal crypto project still, which is nearly the finish of the first module to connect, and disconnect the user.
- Thinking through some more work on my business including a new mini-application that would set-up a new employee on all our systems at once.
- There's a few bits and pieces of things I need to do, but I'll try and get those small things out of the way so that my desk isn't "cluttered".

# What I learnt

- Went through again the book "Clear Thinking" by Shane Parrish, to reiterate the points that he made. I'll come out with my notes in due time once I've finished reading and writing my notes.

# What I did

- Worked through the requirements of the mini-application which would need to do the following:
  - Create a user profile for our:
    - Payroll system;
    - E learning system;
    - WordPress;
    - Timekeeping system;
  - It'd work by the new employee entering their details into the system, and then it's reviewed. If it's all fine then we'd make everything all at once.
  - The end result is that it'd gather the user profiles, create a contract for signature and then send it all as an email.

# What I reviewed

The content that I reviewed today was: [Study Journal entry for 14-03-2024](./sj-20240314.md)

- It was a really short entry, it was more about really just defining a generic data block, and then extending it. The point was that we'd be able to standardise RESTful calls to and fro the database in a much more efficient and predictable way. I never really went further than that.
