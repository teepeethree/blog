## Things I've learnt:

### FOR MYSELF - There's a lot of tools others are using to speed up development.

Now I'm having a hard time discerning what is Android specific and what is Flutter compatible but here's what I'm looking at:

- Jetpack Compose - building UI's (this is compatible with iOS! But in Alpha stages so wary)
- Instead of ListView, I should be using a RecyclerView.
- Nylo is somewhat useless. I thought it was a good approach to avoid boilerplate code though.
- Jetpack Libraries - use this for boilerplate code
- Using the Flutter cookbook for boilerplate code as well.

Really probably should be looking at the documentation more.
