# Diary Entry - 01/03/2024
#### What I'm working on today:
- Trying to finish off the Stocktake Form
- Do some Database Cleanup

#### What I learnt yesterday:
- You don't have to explicitly write ```var int year = 1997``` you can simply put ```var year = 1997```
- 
#### When to learn or when to integrate

| Struggling with syntax errors, types, or data structures. If basic programming constructs, error handling, or understanding asynchronous code (using async, await, Futures, and Streams) is challenging              | Improve your Dart fundamentals       | Dart is the core language of Flutter. A solid grasp of Dart allows you to write more efficient, clean, and error-free code. It's essential for everything from simple scripts to complex Flutter apps.                                                                                                                     |
| Facing issues with UI rendering, state management, or navigating between screens. If creating responsive layouts, managing the app's state effectively, or utilizing lifecycle methods in widgets feels overwhelming | Focus on Flutter-specific concepts   | These challenges are directly related to the Flutter framework and its widget-based architecture. Understanding Flutter better will help you design, optimize, and manage your app's UI and navigation more effectively.                                                                                                   |
| Implementing a feature that seems common and potentially complex, such as payment integration, using Bluetooth, or handling image editing                                                                            | Look for an existing solution        | The Flutter ecosystem is rich with well-maintained packages that can save you time and effort. Using reputable packages for standard functionalities can accelerate development, reduce bugs, and ensure your app remains lightweight and maintainable.                                                                    |
| Repeatedly running into the same problems, writing inefficient code, or struggling to debug issues. If you find it hard to think logically through problems, optimize your code, or understand best practices        | Hone your general programming skills | Improving your programming skills enhances your problem-solving abilities, helps you write more efficient algorithms, and makes it easier to understand and apply best practices in coding and architecture design. It's about developing a mindset that allows you to tackle new and complex challenges more effectively. |

#### Applying the above for today

How do I generally feel about my skills in coding the App?
- I find the syntax quite complex, but if I spend enough time I can generally understand what is happening. It's just that there's so much code that I can get overwhelmed.
- I would say that I occassionally have issues with UI rendering / state management. It's not that often, I usually have a pretty solid grasp on that.
- I don't really like packages because they are often more hassle than they're worth for the time that I have. But I really should try more to implement packages than create my own.
- I definitely am struggling with similar problems, writing fairly inefficient code, and definitely struggle to debug Flutter often.

#### Action Plan based off of those responses:
##### Syntax Complexity and Overwhelm

**Observation:** Dart's syntax complexity and the volume of code can be overwhelming. 
**Action Plan:**
- **Break Down the Code:** Try to break down complex pieces of code into smaller, manageable parts. Understand each part individually before piecing them together.
- **Syntax Practice:** Dedicate time to practicing Dart syntax specifically. Online exercises, coding challenges, and small project snippets can help reinforce your understanding.
- **Code Review:** Spend time reading and understanding well-structured Dart and Flutter code from reputable sources or community projects. This can improve your ability to navigate and comprehend larger codebases.

##### UI Rendering / State Management

**Observation:** Occasional issues with UI rendering and state management, though generally solid. **Action Plan:**

- **Deep Dive Sessions:** For the occasional issues that arise, allocate time for focused learning sessions on those specific topics. Use Flutter's official documentation, which has comprehensive guides on UI and state management.
- **Practice Projects:** Implement what you learn in mini-projects, focusing specifically on the areas you find challenging. This hands-on approach solidifies learning.

##### Reluctance to Use Packages

**Observation:** Hesitancy to use packages due to perceived hassle. **Action Plan:**

- **Package Evaluation:** Start with small, well-documented, and widely used packages to solve common problems. Evaluate the package's documentation, issue tracker, and update frequency to ensure it's maintained and fits your needs.
- **Incremental Integration:** Integrate packages into smaller projects or isolated parts of your app first to gauge their effectiveness and ease of use. This can build your confidence in using third-party solutions without overwhelming your main project.

##### Recurring Problems and Debugging Challenges

**Observation:** Struggles with similar problems, writing inefficient code, and debugging. **Action Plan:**

- **Focused Learning on Debugging:** Invest time in learning advanced debugging techniques in Flutter. Flutter DevTools offers a wide range of debugging features that can help you identify and fix issues more efficiently.
- **Code Optimization:** Learn about common pitfalls in Dart and Flutter development that lead to inefficiency. Resources like performance analysis guides from the Flutter team can be incredibly helpful.
- **Problem-Solving Skills:** Enhance your general problem-solving skills by tackling coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeSignal. This can improve your ability to approach problems logically and efficiently.
- **Peer Review:** If possible, have someone else review your code. Fresh eyes can spot issues you might overlook and suggest optimizations.
