## Where I'm at

- I'm feeling pretty damn tired today. I think I'm coming down with something so I'm just going to take it pretty easy today. I think I'll brush up on some learning for today since I can do that in a pretty relaxed way.

  I think going over Svelte 5's Runes again in more detail would be good. [I'm going to watch this series.](https://youtu.be/-SM77ksjpJI?si=PLduBTKmJWBrNxT6)

## What I learnt

## What I did

- Revisited all of last week's study journal entries, and the important parts to me were:
  - Keeping a flexible development strategy is key to making sure you avoid as many pitfalls as possible from over-engineering to under preparing.
  - Documenting how things are done, including your reasoning on decisions is a critical skill in engineering, especially software engineering. **NB:** This would also mean understanding _why_ certain technology was created to overcome certain issues and to use that to our advantage.
  - Being able to show someone you are competent is so much more powerful than just saying it.
