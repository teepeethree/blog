## What I did

- Revisited all of last week's study journal entries, and the important parts to me were:
  - Keeping a flexible development strategy is key to making sure you avoid as many pitfalls as possible from over-engineering to under preparing.
  - Documenting how things are done, including your reasoning on decisions is a critical skill in engineering, especially software engineering. **NB:** This would also mean understanding _why_ certain technology was created to overcome certain issues and to use that to our advantage.
  - Being able to show someone you are competent is so much more powerful than just saying it.
