# Where I'm at

- Still feeling sick, so another short entry for today.

# What I learnt

- Just going through more foundational topics in JavaScript / TypeScript so I can get a better grasp of how exactly the web applications are being loaded / created / rendered, etc. This seems really elementary to some, but it's good for me to address some gaps in knowledge:
  - Web apps load HTML first, then CSS, then JS / TS.
  - The DOM (Document Object Model) is a JS / TS object that allows us to manipulate the entirety of the document (meaning the web page that's rendered, and all of it's components).
    - Theoretically, we could create an entire web application in JS (less the initial HTML file required), but it'd be quite slow to allow all of the JS to load ... so;
    - That's why we could use something like a virtual DOM (or second order DOM) that creates changes, and then uses a diff method to determine what changed and then only update that.
  - Server-side rendering is basically a compromise between the speed of rendering HTML elements, and bringing in the styling and reactivity later. It allows for the website to load without a delay, but sometimes "pops" which is called a Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC)
  - Streaming SSR is probably a better improvement to this because you could create an illusion of a full web app, without having to load everything at once.
- If we were to use server-side logic in a dApp, we could do things like:
  - Blacklist addresses
  - Use one-time-only tokens for extra security

# What I did

- I did some study, as above
