Let's get started.

## Where I'm at

- Doing some work for personal crypto project. Trying to configure interfaces, and the like.

## What I learnt

- About Astro. Very similar to SvelteKit, but focused on content-driven websites (such as a blog).
- Using Vercel you can use Continuous Deployment. In other words, if you push a commit to Github, that Vercel can automatically rebuilt the website.
  - E.g. creating a new blog post, commit to Github, and then rebuilt using Vercel.
- Astro doesn't like when the published datetime is too far ahead? It's as if the timezone I'm on (UTC) is probably too far in the future, and so it either hides the post because it thinks it's future-dated, or it just omits it. Either way annoying.

## What I did

- I created this personal blog website! I did for a number of reasons:

  - If I want to get a job in tech, it's better that I show that I can do things in a open way, rather than simply telling someone in a way they like.
  - It helps me stay accountable in a way, because my study journal is online.
  - It helps me to refer back to previous ways of thinking, and I can also see where I went wrong, went well, etc.
  - Building my own online presence.

- Uploaded the "Moduo" blog post.
