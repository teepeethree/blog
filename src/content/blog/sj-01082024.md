Let's get started.

## Table of contents

## Where I'm at

Blah.

## What I learnt

- About Astro. Very similar to SvelteKit, but focused on content-driven websites (such as a blog).
- Using Vercel you can use Continuous Deployment. In other words, if you push a commit to Github, that Vercel can automatically rebuilt the website.
  - E.g. creating a new blog post, commit to Github, and then rebuilt using Vercel.

## What I did

- I created a personal blog website. I did for a number of reasons:
  - If I want to get a job in tech, it's better that I show that I can do things in a open way, rather than simply telling someone in a way they like.
  - It helps me stay accountable in a way, because my study journal is online.
  - It helps me to refer back to previous ways of thinking, and I can also see where I went wrong, went well, etc.
  - Building my own online presence.
