## Where I'm at

- **Personal study:** Yesterday was a good day where it started to make more sense what Runes were actually doing. Also I learnt about Mermaid Charts which make flowcharts pretty easy and declarative.
- **Knowledge Base:** Considering going with [`Kit-Docs`](https://github.com/svelteness/kit-docs). I've used them before and they are pretty straightforward.
- **Personal Crypto Project:** Feeling kind of anxious. I feel confident that I can definitely create the damn thing but marketing? Either I spent a shit tonne of money on marketing and leave it someone else, or try and do it myself? I guess the only thing is that I can start to market it full-time after I create it, so I only have to focus on one thing at a time.

## What I did

- Continued with learning about Svelte Runes because that's the hardest thing about Svelte at the moment that I struggle with understanding properly.

  [I moved onto to part 2 of the series I watched yesterday.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezW1gc9GqCg) The next part is about using the `$derived` rune.
