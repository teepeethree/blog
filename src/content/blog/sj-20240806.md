## Where I'm at

- **Personal study:** Yesterday was a good day where it started to make more sense what Runes were actually doing. Also I learnt about Mermaid Charts which make flowcharts pretty easy and declarative.
- **Knowledge Base:** Considering going with [`Kit-Docs`](https://github.com/svelteness/kit-docs). I've used them before and they are pretty straightforward.
- **Personal Crypto Project:** Feeling kind of anxious. I feel confident that I can definitely create the damn thing but marketing? Either I spent a shit tonne of money on marketing and leave it someone else, or try and do it myself? I guess the only thing is that I can start to market it full-time after I create it, so I only have to focus on one thing at a time.

## What I learnt

### Svelte Runes: To use $derived, or to not $derived.

- The $derived rune is used to complete computations on signals ($state runes)
- What's forgotten here is that also functions can also perform computations on signals as well
- The difference being that runes are quite computationally heavy in comparison to a function
  - **Example:** Suppose you had a growable network of nodes component that depended on 5 source signals.
  - If you computed using a function, and then returned that value to 1 node, you'd have created 5 connections. If you had 5 nodes, you'd have created 25 connections.
  - If you computed using a $derived rune, then the computation is cached until the signals changed. If you had 1 node, you'd have 6 connections (5 for source, and 1 for the node connection), but if you had 5 nodes you'd have 10 connections (5 for source, and 5 for the nodes).
  - Expressed mathematically -- where `s = sources`, `c = connections`, and `n = nodes`:
    - Computation by function: `s * n = c`
    - Computation by derived: `s + n = c`
- The long and short of $derived usually comes down to complexity, and computation size. If it's big and hairy, used a $derived rune. Otherwise, in most cases, simply use a function to return computed values.

## What I did

- Continued with learning about Svelte Runes because that's the hardest thing about Svelte at the moment that I struggle with understanding properly.

  [I moved onto to part 2 of the series I watched yesterday.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezW1gc9GqCg) The next part is about using the `$derived` rune.

  That down, [I then moved onto the next part in the series.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFTxHu614OU) Which is about the $effect rune.
