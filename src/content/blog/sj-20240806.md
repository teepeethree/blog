## Where I'm at

- **Personal study:** Yesterday was a good day where it started to make more sense what Runes were actually doing. Also I learnt about Mermaid Charts which make flowcharts pretty easy and declarative.
- **Knowledge Base:** Considering going with [`Kit-Docs`](https://github.com/svelteness/kit-docs). I've used them before and they are pretty straightforward.
- **Personal Crypto Project:** Feeling kind of anxious. I feel confident that I can definitely create the damn thing but marketing? Either I spent a shit tonne of money on marketing and leave it someone else, or try and do it myself? I guess the only thing is that I can start to market it full-time after I create it, so I only have to focus on one thing at a time.

## What I learnt

### Svelte Runes: To use $derived, or to not $derived.

**TL;DR -- Compute using functions, unless it's big and scary then use $derived**

- The `$derived` rune is used to complete computations on signals (`$state` runes)
- What's forgotten here is that also functions can also perform computations on signals as well
- The difference being that runes are quite computationally heavy in comparison to a function
  - **Example:** Suppose you had a growable network of nodes component that depended on 5 source signals.
  - If you computed using a function, and then returned that value to 1 node, you'd have created 5 connections. If you had 5 nodes, you'd have created 25 connections.
  - If you computed using a `$derived` rune, then the computation is cached until the signals changed. If you had 1 node, you'd have 6 connections (5 for source, and 1 for the node connection), but if you had 5 nodes you'd have 10 connections (5 for source, and 5 for the nodes).
  - Expressed mathematically -- where `s = sources`, `c = connections`, and `n = nodes`:
    - Computation by function: `s * n = c`
    - Computation by derived: `s + n = c`
- The long and short of `$derived` usually comes down to complexity, and computation size. If it's big and hairy, used a `$derived` rune. Otherwise, in most cases, simply use a function to return computed values.

### Svelte Runes: Don't use $effect, when you can use $derived instead.

- It took me a while to get my head around the video and the content. But bear with me with an example:
  - **The Rune Restaurant**
  - Imagine a restaurant that has two shifts: Day shift and night shift.
  - They have servers that input orders into the till (These are $state values), and cooks that look at a order screen in the kitchen (These are $derived values).
  - Imagine that the night shift is staffed entirely by vampires (these are $effect values).
    - The vampires are really good at cleaning up, or doing secondary tasks for the next day.
    - But they can't be used to input orders into the till, or to have them cook food. Sure you might be _able_ to, but it's clearly unadvisable in almost all cases.
    - These vampires also act well as a stop gap measure in ensuring tasks are done correctly, double checking things are in order before they are executed.

### Adapting our SOLID heuristic from yesterday:

When we're building a Svelte 5 reactive component, think of the restaurant:

**$state: The till**

- Where orders are placed, and basic information stored
- Directly modifiable and observable
- Changes here trigger updates in the kitchen

**Checklist:**

- What calculations or transformations does your component need?
- What values depend on your $state variables?

**Example:**

- Order totals, kitchen queue, ingredient usage calculations

<br>

**$derived: The kitchen display**

- Shows information based on till inputs
- Automatically updates when till information changes
- Doesn't modify till information directly

**Checklist:**

- What calculations or transformations does your component need?
- What values depend on your $state variables?

**Example:**

- Order totals, kitchen queue, ingredient usage calculations

**$effect: The vampire staff**

- Works after hours, when the main restaurant is closed
- Handles cleanup, analytics, and other behind-the-scenes work
- Useful as a guard for validating tasks, items, etc
- Won't use either the till, or look at the screen directly.

**Checklist:**

- What side effects or external interactions does your component need?
- What tasks should happen after state updates but before the next render?
- What "stop gap" measures or final checks are needed?

**Example:**

- Cleaning up, inventory checks, preparing for the next day, double-checking order accuracy.

#### Remember! While vampires are great at night tasks, don't ask them to operate the till, or cook during the day!

## What I did

- Continued with learning about Svelte Runes because that's the hardest thing about Svelte at the moment that I struggle with understanding properly.

  [I moved onto to part 2 of the series I watched yesterday.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezW1gc9GqCg) The next part is about using the `$derived` rune.

  That down, [I then moved onto the next part in the series.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFTxHu614OU) Which is about the `$effect` rune.
