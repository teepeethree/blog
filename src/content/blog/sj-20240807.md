# Where I'm at

- In the process of migrating all of my old blog posts to this new format and blog space.

# What I learnt

- How to create an endpoint in Astro, you have to tell to stop pre-rendering when you have a hybrid system of some server endpoints and some static content. I think Svelte does this automatically.

# What I did

- Migrated all of my old blog posts to this new platform, the blog entries are fairly sporadic because there were some periods that were missing, or the entry had to be scrubbed of personal details so much so that it was better to just leave it as an empty entry.
- Created a Powershell script to redo the naming and included content for migrating the old blog posts. I also then ended up creating a script to create new study journal entries. _If you want to use these then please feel free, [they're at the root of the git repo.](https://github.com/teepeethree/blog)_
- I created a simple subscribe to mailing list, which captures just:

  ```
  {uuid: number, email: string, active: boolean}
  ```

  Join the cult of personality, I swear there's something you will learn from my emails.
