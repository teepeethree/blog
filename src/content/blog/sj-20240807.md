# Where I'm at

- In the process of migrating all of my old blog posts to this new format and blog space.

# What I did

- Migrated all of my old blog posts to this new platform, the blog entries are fairly sporadic because there were some periods that were missing, or the entry had to be scrubbed of personal details so much so that it was better to just leave it as an empty entry.
- Created a Powershell script to redo the naming and included content for migrating the old blog posts. I also then ended up creating a script to create new study journal entries.
