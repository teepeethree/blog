# Where I'm at

- Continuing on with my study of Javascript

# What I learnt

- Considered the need for defining the shape of a standard block. This standard block could have many common use-cases like a transaction block, but could define a data block (as part of increasing scalability on blockchains for example).

# What I did

- I've got a pretty full day today, so the entry will be relatively short.
