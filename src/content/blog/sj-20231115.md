### Onward - Continuining on with the Stocktake Form - Completion and Submission

Status update - **update in bold (14 / 11 / 2023)**

1.  Completion - about halfway - **underway**
2.  Submission - not much progress -- have psuedocode for submission logic

Tasks for completion for today:

- Finish off state management for individual items and counts
- Refresher / resetter for state management at start of application - when widget is built
- Complete item modal screen - not do stock count / leave that for the main screen – easier for users to complete counts at a glance.
