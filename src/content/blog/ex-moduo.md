# A Balanced Approach to Software Development

Moduo is a simple development methodology that uses natural modes of thinking, and avoid common pitfalls of software design.

## Key Principles:

- **Dual-Mode Thinking:** Separate the abstract / design phase from concrete / implementation phases. This means better mental focus on one cognitive mode at a time.
- **Modular Completion, Not Time Completion:** Projects advance module by module, ensuring manageable chunks of work and continuous integration.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Each module goes through design, implementation, and testing, while allowing for adaptation based on practical insights.

## The Moduo Process:

### Project Start:

Create a thorough README document outlining the project's goals and high-level structure.

### Module Cycle:

1. **Plan:** Write a detailed design document(s) for the module, striving for independance of other modules.
2. **Develop:** Code the module based on the design.
3. **Test:** Thoroughly test the module in isolation and with existing modules.
4. **Reflect:** Make adjustments to design document(s) based on actual code used based on practical insights, or refactor code to re-align to original content until complete.
5. **Repeat:** Repeat the Module Cycle for each component until project completion.

## Benefits of Moduo:

- **Cognitive Clarity:** By separating design and implementation phases, Moduo reduces mental context switching.
- **Adaptability:** The modular approach allows for adjustments without derailing the entire project.
- **Continuous Progress:** Regular completion of functional modules provides tangible progress and opportunities for feedback.
- **Balanced Structure:** Moduo offers enough structure to guide development without stifling creativity or adaptability.
