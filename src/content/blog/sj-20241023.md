# Where I'm at

- I've been really absent, as I had my first son, and he's 6 weeks old now. In the meantime, I've grow so much. Grown to love this little boy, and also work on myself a lot.
- Working through my own personal crypto project, which I feel like is shaping up and refining because of the time I've had away taking care of the baby.

# What I learnt

- That there's only a few key principles of programming that more or less mean the same thing. This is what I got:

1. MANAGE STATE

   - **"How do we track and control information?"**
   - Data storage & retrieval
   - State changes
   - Persistence
   - Memory management
   - Variable scope

2. HANDLE UNCERTAINTY

   - **"What happens when things go wrong?"**
   - Error handling
   - Edge cases
   - Validation
   - Testing
   - Recovery strategies

3. RESPOND TO CHANGE

   - **"How do we react to events?"**
   - Event handling
   - User interactions
   - System events
   - Data updates
   - Communication patterns

4. ORGANIZE CODE

   - **"How do we structure our solutions?"**
   - Architecture
   - Modularity
   - Code reuse
   - Dependencies
   - Project structure

5. TRANSFORM DATA

   - **"How do we convert information?"**
   - Data processing
   - Type conversion
   - Data flow
   - Formatting
   - Parsing

6. CONTROL TIMING

   - **"When should things happen?"**
   - Async operations
   - Scheduling
   - Concurrency
   - Synchronization
   - Order of operations

7. MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY

   - **"How do we keep things valid?"**
   - Data integrity
   - Business rules
   - Validation
   - Verification
   - Invariants

8. MANAGE COMPLEXITY
   - **"How do we make it understandable?"**
   - Abstraction
   - Documentation
   - Mental models
   - Learning paths
   - Human factors

- I feel like a good majority of tasks more or less break down into those universal programming concepts, and that there's a lot of "same game, different name" type of work going on in the world of tech.
- On a personal level, I think I've come to terms with more of my perfectionism, there's a lot to it, but I think it comes down to some biological, and some mindset issues. I'm working through them now, and it's really helping me actually start instead of suffering ahead of time.

# What I did

- I updated this [post about ADHD, and now includes perfectionism.](ex-adhd.md) I put my thoughts down on paper about my perfectionism, which stems from a belief that I'm already at #1, or I because I have the capability to being #1, then anything less than, will cause me to suffer in imagination ahead of time while I struggle to figure out all the details that made the #1, into #1.

# What I reviewed

The content that I reviewed today was: [Study Journal entry for 03-10-2023](./sj-20231003.md)

- I think I considered this before, but it's a good resource on complying with ICO requirements here in the UK. Not much more that I can explain other than that, it's more legal than coding.
