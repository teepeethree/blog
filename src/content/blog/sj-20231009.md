## Things I've learnt:

### DESIGN EVOLUTION - Continue with Flutter, use Compose where possible.

Yeah so Flutter is definitely the way to go for now - we can migrate later if it's really an issue later on.

### DESIGN EVOLUTION - This is the new model. Actually. Please stay on track.

#### **Mapping to Clean Architecture:**

**Presentation Layer**:

- Maps to the **app/** layer in Clean Architecture.
- Specifically, the **pages/** and **widgets/** directories.

**Abstraction between Presentation and Logic**:

- This is represented by the **Controller** and **Presenter** in the **app/** layer. They define what actions can be taken based on user interactions but don't dictate the exact logic.

**Logic Layer**:

- This is represented by the **usecases/** in the **domain/** layer. They orchestrate the flow of data and decide what actions to take based on user input and other conditions.

**Abstraction between Logic and Data**:

- This is represented by the abstract **repositories/** in the **domain/** layer. They define what data operations can be performed but don't dictate how they're executed.

**Data Access Layer**:

- This is represented by the **data/** and **device/** layers in Clean Architecture. They provide concrete implementations of the abstract repositories and define how data is accessed and manipulated.

**Abstraction between Data Access and Database**:

- In the context of Clean Architecture and your current setup, this abstraction is inherently handled by the Firestore SDK and the way you interact with it through your **data/** layer.

**Database**:

- This is Firestore in your case. It's the actual storage where your data resides.

#### Folder Structure - Please use this

## Things I NEED to learn:

### How the hell am I supposed to join up things I've grabbed from sample apps or example code?

That's all well and great that I can see the capabilities but surely I'm supposed to use this to speed up development time?

Or is it merely a showcase of items of what can be done? Why are all the sample apps so basic?
