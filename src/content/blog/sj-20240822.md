# Where I'm at

- Working through mental models of a blockchain that is capable of handling large datasets, at scale, and with security. Basically it's a direct counter to Chainlink's oracle solution, instead of having an intermediary like Chainlink, you have your own data stored directly on chain.
- Working through my personal crypto stuff, and working through some of the core functionality.
- Working through my Javascript book study, and understanding more of it.

The content that I reviewed today was: [Study Journal entry for 04-10-2023](./sj-20231004.md)

- This was when I starting out creating my mobile app:
  - I did correctly deduct that I needed a debug console to test out functionality on a micro level, and in a way that was isolated from the context of the rest of the application.
  - I was bashing my head against a wall not understanding custom claims properly as a way to give / revoke access to certain content / features.
  - I had thought long and hard about a way to actually achieve it without knowing about custom claims properly, and so I created a unified matrix of controls. It's pretty complicated but also was a useful thought experiment to consider how each user would see different content, etc. It would've been an incredibly complex system though.
  - It does show how I was thinking about the entire system in a holistic way, and that I had tried to consider the different aspects of each part of the control system.
- Also pointed out a things such as my own ADHD which makes it difficult to remember things. Another reason why this blog is so important.
