# What I learnt

## Things I've learnt:

### PERSONAL - I can be thrown off balance by a seemingly small irritation

Like the stupid scam callers calling me today!

That has thrown off my entire day and I made some progress on Mastermind but man I feel it's hard to get back into the mood again.

### MASTERMIND - What am I doing here?

So it's taken a while to get back onto Mastermind development.

The good things since I've done Mastermind development:

- Much clearer idea on how software development happens
- Understanding the need to have really clear ideas on really granular
- Understood more about the cycle of planning, development, testing and deployment.
- Understand the separation of concerns to make things more understandable and predictable.

But then on the other handâ€¦ What I've then realised about Mastermind:

- I have quite a limited scope of what I'm trying to develop - I don't understand how I'd create it from start to end.
- While planning is critical to avoid having to redo work later on, it's kind of frustrating not being able to just jump in and start developing.
