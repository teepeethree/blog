# Where I'm at

## What I'm studying (a bit) - Head First Javascript

### Notes from yesterday:

- Functions = resuable code to name and forget for later
- Data (primitives) = strings, ints, boolean. More complex data => Ordered Data. Choice in JS is **Array**

# What I learnt

### **Notes from today:**

- Need to tune my brain into ways it can effectively learn and not let it tell me this is not important

# What I did

## Leetcode - Problem #1

Ok back to this question - let's see how I go.

### Question

Write a function `createHelloWorld`. It should return a new function that always returns `"Hello World"`.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

**Input:** args = \[\]

**Output:** "Hello World"

**Explanation:** const f = createHelloWorld(); f(); // "Hello World" The function returned by createHelloWorld should always return "Hello World".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** args = \[{},null,42\]

**Output:** "Hello World"

**Explanation:** const f = createHelloWorld(); f({}, null, 42); // "Hello World" Any arguments could be passed to the function but it should still always return "Hello World".

### **Notes**

### End Result

Not attempted - still require more time to learn in JS before I can attempt that problem

## OutSystems - Architecture and Stuff

Using BPT? I don't know what they're really for… but the development flow is basically the same:

- Data
- Logic
- UI
- Processes (Processes and Timers)
