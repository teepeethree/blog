I'm based in the UK, currently working on a few things at the moment.

## How I built this blog

It's a very simple set-up, and you could probably spin up a clone of this blog within a few hours even if you are a beginner.

It comprises of:

- Storing the application code, and content on Github;
- Deploying the code / content to a Vercel instance; and
- Configuring Vercel to use my domain that I purchased.

## How to connect

I'm usually more than happy to chat and partner with others if it fits in well with my own schedule.

If you send me a message, or email and I ignore you, don't take it personally. I usually get around to geniune emails.

If you have any changes / issues / whatever you can contribute by going the [repo](https://github.com/teepeethree/blog) and opening a pull request.
